For some reason, they lights don't work sometimes when the first animation command is send. The relay clicks, but nothing happens. 
It seems journalctl shows workers being terminated with sigkill.
When the service is restarted, the lights still don't work but no errors are shown.
Perhaps there is an issue with the pin to which the lights are connected?
